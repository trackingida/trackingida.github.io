	<h1>Tracking Ida</h1>
	<p>The website is currently under construction! We ran the experience March 21 - March 27, and are currently editing the documentary footage. Enjoy some rough cut footage in the meantime :)

	<p>Tracking Ida is an educational alternate reality game (ARG) inspired by the pioneering investigative journalism of Ida B. Wells in the 1890s. Players follow the example of Wellsâ€™ crusade against lynching and apply her strategies to an investigation of police and vigilante killings today.</p>
	<p>Along the way, they solve puzzles, comb through historical archives (with the help of a phonograph), role-play as investigative journalists, and harness various forms of media to spread awareness about current issues affecting their community.</p>

	<h2>Explanation Video</h2>
	<p>Here's a rough cut video explaining the game, it's historical inspiration and goals, and the impact it had on the students who played the pilot.</p>
