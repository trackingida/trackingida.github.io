	<h2>Playthrough (Rough Cut)</h2>
	<p>Here's a rough cut! Better version with an explanation voice-over will be ready in a couple days.</p>
	<p>This is an accelerated playthrough. If you want to follow the narrative, pause the video when I zoom into artifacts and notes.</p>

	<h2>Tracking Ida Sneak Peak</h2>
	<p>Tracking Ida is an educational alternate reality game (ARG) inspired by the pioneering investigative journalism of Ida B. Wells in the 1890s. Players follow the example of Wellsâ€™ crusade against lynching and apply her strategies to an investigation of police and vigilante killings today.</p>
	<p>Along the way, they solve puzzles, comb through historical archives (with the help of a phonograph), role-play as investigative journalists, and harness various forms of media to spread awareness about current issues affecting their community.</p>

	 <h2>Qualitative Research (Sneak Peak)</h2>
	 <p>We conducted focus group interviews with 22 of the 80 high school students who played Tracking Ida in school. We are currently conducting qualitative research (coding interview transcripts, etc) to determine the educational outcomes and impact of the game on this group of students. Exciting conclusions to come, but here's some video of our process in the meantime.</p>

		<h2>About this game:</h2>
		<p>The Locker is a mixed-reality installation game in which you explore physical artifacts with your hands and reveal memories using a bewitched magnifying glass. 
		<p>You receive a note from Jade, a student at your high school who has recently gone missing, and decide to do some snooping. Inside her locker, you find diary entries to read, physical puzzles to solve, artifacts to investigate, and memories to reveal with your magnifying glass. 
		<p>Combining physical exploration with puzzle and film, the Locker will engage quite a few of your senses for a memorable experience.
