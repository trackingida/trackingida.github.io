	<h1>Tracking Ida</h1>
	
	<p>Tracking Ida is an educational alternate reality game (ARG) inspired by the pioneering investigative journalism of Ida B. Wells in the 1890s. Players follow the example of Wellsâ€™ crusade against lynching and apply her strategies to an investigation of police and vigilante killings today.</p>
	<p>Along the way, they solve puzzles, comb through historical archives (with the help of a phonograph), role-play as investigative journalists, and harness various forms of media to spread awareness about current issues affecting their community.</p>
	
	<h2>Explanation Video</h2>
	<p>Here's a rough cut video explaining the game, it's historical inspiration and goals, and the impact it had on the students who played the pilot.</p>

	 <h3>Qualitative Research Behind-the-Scenes</h3>
	 <p>We conducted focus group interviews with 22 of the 80 high school students who played Tracking Ida in school. We are currently conducting qualitative research (coding interview transcripts, etc) to determine the educational outcomes and impact of the game on this group of students. Exciting conclusions to come, but here's some footage of our process in the meantime.</p>
